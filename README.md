### ~ In development, contributions and participation welcome ~

A R package to interact with the Open Canada API, to search and download datasets. It is our hope that we will be able to bring this package up to the standard of a `ropensci` packages (see this issue on `ropensci/wishlist` https://github.com/ropensci/wishlist/issues/27). 

This package will wrap `ckanr` to access the canadian government's CKAN REST API. 

The code is under GPL-3 license. 
All the data is under Open Government License (http://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada).
