# ropencan

~ In development, contributions and participation welcome ~

A R package to interact with the Open Canada API, to search and download datasets. It is our hope that we will be able to bring this package up to the standards of all `ropensci` packages. 

The code is under GPL-3 license. 
All the data is under Open Government License (http://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada). 

## List of functionalities 

The function `opencan_search` performs basic queries and outputs a `data.frame` with all the query results.
