[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VLucet/rgovcan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vlucet/rgovcan)

A R package to interact with the Open Canada API, to search and download datasets. It is our hope that we will be able to bring this package up to the standard of a `ropensci` packages (see this issue on `ropensci/wishlist` https://github.com/ropensci/wishlist/issues/27).

This package makes extensive use of `ckanr` to access the Canadian government's CKAN REST API.

The code is under GPL-3 license.

## Installation

Until release to CRAN, you will need to use `devtools` to install from source.

```r
devtools::install_github("vlucet/rgovcan")
```

## Usage

1. First, load the package. The default `ckanr` url will be set to the Open Canada Portal.
```{r}
library("rgovcan")
```
If you happen to change the default url, you can reset it back to the default with `govcan_setup`.
```{r}
govcan_setup()
```

2. A typical workflow with `rgovcan` can start with running `govcan_search` on a given set of keywords. This yields a `stack` of `ckan_packages` (object of class `ckan_package_stack`).
```{r}
dfo_search <- govcan_search(keywords = c("dfo"), records = 10)
dfo_search # outputs a `ckan_package_stack`
```
see `?govcan_search` for further details.

3. Another possibility is to start with a package id corresponding to an actual record and retrieve a `ckan_package`.
```{r}
id <- "7ac5fe02-308d-4fff-b805-80194f8ddeb4" # Package ID
id_search <- govcan_get_record(record_id = id)
id_search # outputs a `ckan_package`
```

4. Once the packages have been retrieved from the portal, you can use `govcan_get_resources` on those results to display the `ckan_resource`s contained in the packages (a "resource" is any dataset attached to a given record). This outputs a `ckan_resource_stack` when called on a unique package.
```{r}
id_resources <- govcan_get_resources(id_search)
id_resources # outputs a `resource_stack`
```
Or a list of stacks if called onto a `ckan_package_stack`.
```{r}
dfo_resources <- govcan_get_resources(dfo_search)
dfo_resources # outputs a list of `resource_stack`s
```

5. Finally, you can download the resources with `govcan_dl_resources`. These can either be stored to a certain directory or load into session (* this option might fail due to current issues with `ckanr::ckan_fetch`).

```{r}
path <- "tmp/data/"
dir.create(path, recursive = TRUE)
govcan_dl_resources(id_resources, file_formats = c("JSON", "CSV", "SHP"), where = path)
# govcan_dl_resources(res_pel, file_formats = c("JSON", "CSV", "SHP"), where = "session")
```

see `?govcan_dl_resources` for further details.
